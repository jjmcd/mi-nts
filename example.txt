I don't have a line on any off the shelf FOSS applications, although I
bet there is something out there.  I use a PHP script to generate a
monthly report as a PDF.  

I use a PDF class for PHP but it appears it has been updated since I
downloaded it many moons ago.  It looks to be at http://ros.co.nz/pdf/
but mine relies on fpdf, which also seems to be around, but it looks
like the current version doesn't.  So my examples might not be all
that useful.

I was going to include the stuff I use but the zip is a bit large for
this list.  Besides the actual class there are a few fonts which take
plenty of space.

I've attached a sample which I've hacked up some.  I use this monthly
to generate a report.  I've taken important bits from the include
files and pasted them into it, and left out uninteresting functions.

Basically, you connect to a database by something like

$db = mysql_connect($host , $dbuser, $dbpassword);
mysql_select_db($DatabaseName,$db);

Generally, you want to read the password from a file outside the web
server's reach.

Then you do queries by something like


    $query="SELECT MAX(`period`) FROM `arpsc_ecrept`";
    $result = mysql_query($query,$db);
    $period = mysql_fetch_row($result,$db);

if you are only returning a single scalar from the database, or more like

    $query="`id`,`name` FROM `people`";
    $result = mysql_query($query,$db);
    while ( $row = mysql_fetch_row($result,$db)
    {
      echo $row[0] . "\t" . $row[1] . "\n";
    }

if you are fetching multiple rows.  Obviously, there is error checking
you may want to do; I tend to wrap that in my own functions.

For the PDF

  $PageSize = array(0,0,$Page_Width,$Page_Height);
  $pdf = & new Cpdf($PageSize);
  $pdf->SetTextColor(0,0,0);
  $pdf->selectFont('helvetica-Bold');
  $FontSize=18;
  $pdf->addText($XPos,$YPos,$FontSize,_('blah, blah, blah'));

then

  $buf = $pdf->output();
  $len += strlen($buf);

  header('Content-type: application/pdf');
  header('Content-Length: ' . $len);
  header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=' . $DateShort . '-rpt.pdf');
  header('Expires: 0');
  header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0');
  header('Pragma: public');

  $pdf->stream()

?>

Yeah, all the text positioning can get kinda grody, but it does work.
The example has functions for a new page, header, etc.

Hope that helps.
